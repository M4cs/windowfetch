### Overview
Winfetch is an alternative program for neofetch/screenfetch made for Windows! It allows you to display system information through your command line without needing to have any hacky bash fixes to run neofetch. It's also faster!

For More information and detailed instructions on configuration and installation read the [Wiki here](https://github.com/M4cs/winfetch/wiki)
